# Don't touch the droid! JavaFX-sample-1

## Sample JavaFX ML app. Ported from a previous Android exercise.

Sample exercise on how to implement a *click listener* to detect a click on an image (ImageView object), and a Timeline object to display the time upon program startup.

The program detects user clicks on the image and shows a count of it.

Also, it displays the current time and displays a proper greeting for it (i.e. Good morning, good afternoon, good evening).

Folders of interest:

- src: Includes the actual source code for the program.
- dist: Includes the compiled program targeted for different environments (web app, local file...).
  If you are not sure which one to run, Android,jar is the file you are looking for. Notice that you need to have [Java][1] installed on your computer.
